<em>Resume<em>
<h1 align="center"> :mega: Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h1>



I tell you about me:

My professional career spans over 30 years in key financial management and control roles, with a focus on driving results optimization and achieving strategic organizational objectives. Throughout my tenure in previous roles, I have demonstrated strong skills in financial analysis, budget planning, management control, and team leadership.

My recent experience as a Senior Risk Analyst in a major insurance company has allowed me to conduct detailed economic and financial analyses, assessing policyholders' ability to fulfil contracts. Additionally, I have spearheaded strategic initiatives at Escudo Seguros S.A., including report development for the Board of Directors and proposals to enhance the company's financial performance.

I highlight my ability to develop and implement advanced financial models and my experience in budget coordination and financial controls, as evidenced by my tenure at TPC Seguros S.A. and Orbis Campania Argentina de Seguros S.A.

Before working in insurance companies, I worked in banks, which is why I know the movement of the Financial Sector.

My technical skills include advanced proficiency in MS Excel, knowledge of management systems, and strong negotiation abilities. Furthermore, my proactive approach and team leadership skills have been instrumental in my success in all previous roles.

I am currently in a reconversion process, moving into the incredible and dizzying world of programming and manipulation of large volumes of data, for analysis and developing proposals for improvement.
